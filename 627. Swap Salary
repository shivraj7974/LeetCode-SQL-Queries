Write a solution to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.

Note that you must write a single update statement, do not write any select statement for this problem.

The result format is in the following example.

 Update salary 
set sex = Case sex 
    when 'm' then 'f'
    else 'm'
    end;
