Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

SELECT ( CASE
 WHEN id%2 != 0 AND id != counts THEN id+1
WHEN id%2 != 0 AND id = counts THEN id
ELSE id-1  END) AS id, student
FROM seat, (select count(*) as counts from seat) 
AS seat_counts       #//first we count seat 
ORDER BY id ASC
